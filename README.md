# listeninglist

Train your ability to recognize the pieces required for Music Literature
1, 2, 3, and 4. Made specifically for Marianopolis Music students.

## Maintaining

Edit `pieces.json` accordingly, and place short (<30s) mp3s for each piece
in the appropriate ML folder in `static`. Make sure the links in `pieces.json`
point to the github links to be able to use this (and share this) from the
github pages link. Since github pages does not store mp3s with it, paths
to local files *will not work*. However, you can use local paths for
testing purposes.
